## Inspiration
We've all seen job postings with ridiculous requirements. Half the time there are ones listed that aren't actually needed. Usually there are skills not listed that are tested during interviews.

If you're someone from a disadvantaged educational background, or if you're trying to break into a new field, the lack of knowledge of which skills are truly necessary presents a huge barrier.

## What it does
SkillView lets people crowdsource data about what was truly tested in their experiences from applying to and working in jobs. The data is presented to end users for free so they can prioritize their learning time, apply to opportunities they would otherwise think they don't qualify for, and avoid wasting time on jobs that aren't what they're actually looking for.

## How I built it
Front end was written in Vue.js using Vuetify. Visualizations were done using D3.js.

## Challenges I ran into
Learning new concepts from the frameworks we used.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
We turned our mock-ups into a real website using a modern framework and completed nice data visualizations.

## What I learned
We learned how to make new kinds of website components and visualizations with Vue and D3.

## What's next for SkillView
If we had more time we'd scrape data from glassdoor and linkedin to and analyze it to show real insights into certain jobs.
